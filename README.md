# python-api-challenge

Part 1: WeatherPy
I have utilised tutors, preveious code used in activities, notes, as well as instructor and TA support

In this deliverable, I have create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. 
I have used citipy Python libraryLinks to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap APILinks to an external site., and problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

WeatherPy.ipynb Jupyter notebook provided in the starter code ZIP file. 

Requirement 1: 

Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude

To fulfill the first requirement, you'll use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the starter code. Next, you'll create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

Latitude vs. Temperature

Latitude vs. Humidity

Latitude vs. Cloudiness

Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship
To fulfill the second requirement, compute the linear regression for each relationship. Separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude). You may find it helpful to define a function in order to create the linear regression plots.

Next, create a series of scatter plots. Be sure to include the linear regression line, the model's formula, and the r values as you can see in the following image
